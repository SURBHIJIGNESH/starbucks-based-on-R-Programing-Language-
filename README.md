## Modeling

For each pair of explanatory/response variables 

1. Identify the explanatory variable. 
2. Identify the response variable.
3. Create a linear regression model and display the full output of the model. 
4. Using the variables noted in #1 and #2 above and the results of #3, write the equation for your model. 
5. Explain what the intercept means in the context of the data. 
6. Is the intercept a useful/meaningful value in the context of our data? If yes, explain. If not, explain what purpose it serves. 
7. Explain what the slope means in the context of the data.

## Model Assessment

1. Which metric can you use to choose between the two models you just created? 
2. Explain what this metric means and why it is good for comparing models. 
3. According to this metric, which model is the best of the two you created? Why? 

## Model Diagnostics

NOTE: Even if you think your model fails one of the diagnostic tests, please provide an answer for ALL 
diagnostics. Your answers below should contain three plots. 

Now that you have chosen your best model, you need to determine if it is reliable or not:

1. Create two new data columns based on your best model: predicted values for your response 
variable and the corresponding residuals. 
2. Create a plot to check the assumption of linearity. State whether or not this condition is met 
and explain your reasoning. 
3. Create a plot to check the assumption of nearly normal residuals. State whether or not this 
condition is met and explain your reasoning. 
4. Create a plot to check the assumption of constant variability. State whether or not this 
condition is met and explain your reasoning. 

## Conclusion
1. Based on the results of the “Model Diagnostics” section above, what can you conclude about 
your model?
